# bulldozer blue book price prediction

This project aims to build a ML model that can predict the auction/sale price for a piece of heavy machinery based upon past sales data.

The data for this project was obtained from the Kaggle competition "Blue Book for Bulldozers", available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

Intermediate/Final datasets as well as all models are not provided in this repository but can be created by running the included Jupyter Notebook. Prior to running , please be sure to update the 'basedir' variable to the correct path for your project setup. This will be used for loading and saving all files during the analysis.
